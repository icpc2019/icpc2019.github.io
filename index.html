 ICPC 2020 - Call for Papers 
28th International Conference on Program Comprehension
<br>
 
 Program comprehension is a vital software development and maintenance activity. 
 It facilitates reuse, inspection, reverse engineering, reengineering, migration, and extension of the ever-more pervasive existing and future software systems. 
The IEEE International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC) is the main venue for work in program comprehension, which encompasses both the human activity of comprehending software as well as the processes and technologies supporting it. ICPC 2020 provides the quality conference for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to discuss state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art results and lesson learned in program comprehension. 
ICPC 2020 solicits technical research papers, tool-demonstration papers, and other tracks papers. 
 Topics of interest for all tracks include but are not limited to <br>
 
 <li>Tool support for program comprehension; </li>
<li>Novel visualization techniques and interfaces to support program comprehension, including searching, browsing and analyzing;</li>
<li>Novel text summarisation techniques and interfaces to support program comprehension, including searching, browsing and analyzing;</li>
<li>Cognitive theories for program comprehension, including experiments, empirical studies, and case studies;</li>
<li>Individual, collaborative, distributed, and global program comprehension;</li>
<li>Comprehension of specific types of software systems, such as open/closed source, mobile applications, spreadsheets, web-based systems, legacy systems, product lines, libraries, multi-threaded 
 applications, and systems of systems;</li>
<li>Comprehension in the context of diverse software process models and specific lifecycle activities, 
 such as: maintenance, evolution, re-engineering, migration, security, auditing, and testing;</li>
<li>Comprehension of software artifacts ranging from requirements documents to test cases and crash logs; 
 from API documentation to models, meta-models and model transformation; and from Stack Overflow questions & answers to 
 GitHub code review messages - all artifacts software developer encounters when creating or evolving software.</li>
<li>Empirical evaluations of program comprehension tools, techniques, and approaches;</li>
<li>Human aspects in program comprehension;</li>
<li>Comprehension and legal issues, such as due diligence, intellectual property, reverse engineering, and litigation;</li>
